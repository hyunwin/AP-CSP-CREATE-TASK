# AP-CSP-CREATE-TASK
This project was part of the AP Computer Science Principles Test and for the Create Task portion of the test, I created a 2D side-scrolling platformer with unique personally designed spirtes.
I made this type of game because I am a huge fan of the genre and wanted to make something out of my own personal interest.
